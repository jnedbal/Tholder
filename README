Model for a 3D-printed Dolomite Thin T-Junction chip

Matlab script producing the 3D model of the holder for Dolomite T-junction chip in BRL-CAD format. Its STL representation and a movie for presentation purposes are also generated. The script assumes BRL-CAD installation in folder: "/usr/brlcad/bin/". It also requires installation of mencoder to produce the movies.

The script is designed to run on Linux. It was developed and tested on Debian Wheezy. It should run on other Linux distributions and only slight modificationsin terms of providing the correct paths to mged and mencoder should be needed to make it compatible with various flavours of Windows and MAC OS X.
